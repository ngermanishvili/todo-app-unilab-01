To-Do App with Protected Routes
This is a To-Do app that allows users to create and manage tasks. The app features protected routes, meaning that users must be authenticated to access certain parts of the application. Once a user has logged in, they will not be able to go back to the login page until they have logged out.


The app uses the styled-components module for CSS, which allows for dynamic styling using JavaScript. LocalStorage is also utilized to save user information and task data so that it persists across browser sessions.


How to Use
To use the app, simply visit the login page and enter your credentials. Once authenticated, you will be able to access the To-Do list page. From there, you can add tasks and mark them as completed. The navbar section displays the user's name and an option to log out.
